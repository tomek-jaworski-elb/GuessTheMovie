# GuessTheMovie
*Project from the Udacity.com classes -Object Oriented Programming in Java*
------
The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.

If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over!

BUT the more correct letters you guess the more obvious the movie becomes and at a certain point you should be able to figure it out.

The program will randomly pick a movie title from a text file that contains a large list of movies.

You can download a sample text file to play with from the resources tab or create your own list of movie titles.
Once the computer picks a random title, it will display underscores "_" in place of the real letters, thereby only giving away the number of letters in the movie title.
